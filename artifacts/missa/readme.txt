the run.sh bash files in each <year> subfolder will produce complete .html files for each day's mass.
both high mass and low mass versions are created for each day.
one may then copy the said .html files to one's mobile device for usage during mass, without the need for a wifi/internet connection.
(one tlm chapel i attend has no mobile phone or internet reception at all!)
